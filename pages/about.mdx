About RDM

Why is RDM important?
---

- To make data **FAIR**: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable​
- To comply with policies: e.g. NWO grants require DMP, personal data requires ethical review and data privacy​
- To make sure your Ph.D. research output can still contribute value after your Ph.D. has been completed​
- *To quantify the research output of IvI* — not only publications, but also **data and code​**
